This is just a simple file I decided to add to add a few notes that
may interest people. You SHOULD read this at a minimum for upgrades.


NOTE: Upgrades From 0.9.99:

The default port has changed to 7101, and the default font
directory has moved to /usr/share/fonts/truetype. If you wish to know
why then read the other Docs. You can easily change these back.
