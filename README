This is just a simple file I decided to add to add a few notes that
may interest people. You SHOULD read this at a minimum for upgrades.


NOTE: Upgrades From 0.9.99:

For starters there is now a "Debian" directory as I have decided to
merge the Debian version and "Upstream" version. This will make life
easier on me. The Debian directory only contains a couple of text files.
It is not large and will not affect anyone who is not on a Debian system.

I would be happy to add other SMALL directories for packageing
on other systems if anyone sends me some.

Secondly. The default port has changed to 7101, and the default font
directory has moved to /usr/share/fonts/truetype. If you wish to know
why then read the other Docs. You can easily change these back.
