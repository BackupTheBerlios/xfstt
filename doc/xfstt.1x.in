.SH DESCRIPTION
Xfstt serves TrueType fonts to X11 servers. Start xfstt then tell X11 about
the font server with
.B "xset fp+ unix/:7101"
or (assuming the X11 server runs on host 127.0.0.1)
.B "xset fp+ inet/127.0.0.1:7101"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-sync
Synchronize the font database with installed fonts and exit when done.
Don't do this while xfstt is running.
.TP
.B \-\-gslist
Print font list in a format usable for ghostscript during
.BR \-\-sync .
.TP
.BI \-\-user " username"
This is a security feature which is designed to lessen the impact of
any future security holes which are found in xfstt. This will cause
xfstt to set its UID and GID to that of the specified user
(if that user doesn't exist then it will use your current UID and GID)
.TP
.BI \-\-encoding " item" [ ",..." ]
Remap to different encodings, listed each separated by a comma. Default
is iso8859-1. Usage example:
.br
.B xfstt \-\-encoding iso8859-2,koi8-r,windows-1251
.TP
.BI \-\-port " number"
Change the port number for xfstt's font services.
This version of Xfstt defaults to port
.IR 7101 .
.TP
.B \-\-notcp
Don't open TCP socket, use unix domain only.
.TP
.BI \-\-dir " name"
Change xfstt's font directory.
The default directory is
.IR @datadir@/fonts/truetype .
.TP
.BI \-\-cache " name"
Change xfstt's font cache directory.
The default directory is
.IR @localstatedir@/cache/xfstt .
.TP
.BI \-\-pidfile " name"
Change xfstt's pidfile location.
The default file name is
.IR @localstatedir@/run/xfstt.pid .
.TP
.BI \-\-res " value"
Force the resolution for underspecified fonts to value (typically 96 or 120).
Default is the value the X11 server suggests which can be adjusted by the
-dpi option of the X11 server. Standard X11 servers have defaults of 72 dpi.
.TP
.B \-\-unstrap
Allow some more unicode characters. This is dangerous for many X11 servers.
Start the X server with the "-deferglyphs 16" option to give the X server
a better chance of surviving. For very carefully implemented X servers you
may recompile with UNSTRAPLIMIT set to 65535 in order to get the complete
unicode range.
.TP
.B \-\-once
Exit after the font client disconnects.
.TP
.B \-\-multi
Opposite of
.B \-\-once
option. This has become the default behaviour,
so it is obsolete now and is ignored for backwards compatibility.
It will be removed in a future release.
.TP
.B \-\-inetd
Tell xfstt to be used as inetd service.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon
Behave like a daemon.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print brief usage information on standard output and exit.
