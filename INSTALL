Installation Notes
------------------

These install instructions should suffice for 98% of all users. For more
advanced requirements refer to the xfstt(1x) man page or the FAQ.

CVS Sources
-----------

0) Maintainer setup

   You will need this software:

	autoconf >= 2.53
	automake >= 1.5
	gettext  == 0.12.1

   And running the following command on the source dir:

	$ ./autogen.sh

   At this stage the source should be equivalent to the distributed tar
   source.

Distributed tar Sources
-----------------------

1) Configuring

	$ ./configure [options]

   For all available options see "configure --help". If you want later to
   install in a different directory you may be interested in --prefix
   and --localestatedir options.

2) Compiling. You will need the X header files.

	$ make && make install

   (use gmake instead of the standard make on FreeBSD)

3) Copy some truetype (.ttf) files or create symlinks to truetype directories
   in the default installation directory /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype
   (note that this directory may be changed in the configure step). Then to
   generate the font databases:

	$ xfstt --sync

4) Start xfstt in the background. You may put this on the boot init sequence.
   If your distribution has a System V init then take a look at the example
   initrc file provided in the docs/examples dirs. Else if your distro uses
   a BSD init you can add the following line to the /etc/rc.local file.

	$ xfstt --daemon

5) Tell your X11 server about the new font service:

	$ xset fp+ unix/:7101

   or add the new fontpath to the X11 config file, Section "Files", on
   XFree86 4.0 and above, the file can be found on /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

	FontPath "unix/:7101"

   Read FAQ item 2.1 if you are having problems after doing this.
