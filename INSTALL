1) Type in
	make && make install
   (use gmake instead of the standard make on FreeBSD)

2) Create a writeable directory /usr/share/fonts/truetype, copy some truetype *.ttf
   files or create soflinks to truetype directories in there, then run
	xfstt --sync

3) Start xfstt in the background
	xfstt &

4) Tell your X11 server about the new font service
	xset fp+ unix/:7101
   or add the new fontpath to the X11 config file
	FontPath "unix/:7101"
   Read FAQ item 2.1 if you are having problems after doing this.

These install instructions should suffice for 98% of all users. For more
advanced requirements refer to the xfstt(1x) man page or the FAQ.
