Installation Notes
------------------

These install instructions should suffice for 98% of all users. For more
advanced requirements refer to the xfstt(1x) man page or the FAQ.

CVS Sources
-----------

0) Maintainer setup

 You will need this software:

	autoconf >= 2.53
	automake >= 1.5
	gettext  == 0.11.5

 $ ./autogen.sh

 At this stage the source should be equivalent to the distributed tar source.

Distributed tar Sources
-----------------------

1) Compiling

 $ ./configure [options]

 $ make && make install
   (use gmake instead of the standard make on FreeBSD)

2) Create a writeable directory /usr/share/fonts/truetype, copy some
   truetype *.ttf files or create soflinks to truetype directories
   in there, then run

	xfstt --sync

3) Start xfstt in the background

	xfstt &

4) Tell your X11 server about the new font service

	xset fp+ unix/:7101

   or add the new fontpath to the X11 config file, Section "Files", on
   XFree86 4.0 the file can be found on /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

	FontPath "unix/:7101"

   Read FAQ item 2.1 if you are having problems after doing this.
